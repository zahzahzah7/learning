import os
os.system ("say Hello")
# os means operating system
#___________________________________________________________________________
# * means times
# ** is to the power of/exponents
# + is plus
# / is dividing
# += is just like 5 + 10 = 15 or 5 += 10 same thing just makes the e
# quation smaller
# syntaxerror means you did something incorrect like you cannot use 
# upercases it stuff like print.
# you must use " at the beggining and start in the (" ")
# like this if not used and you said hello = 10 then wrote down 
# print (hello) it would say 10 but if you use " like this: print 
# ("hello") it would only say hello not 10
# if you did Hi = 10 and then do print (Hi) it says 10 because hello 
# equals 10
# you can combine stuff for ex: A = 1 B = 2 then you write print (A +B)
# it will say 3 becuase 1 plus 2 equals 3
# upercause and lower case like a = 1 but A = 2 lets say then if I did 
# upercase 
# or lowercase it would be what I said upercause or lowercause equals
# a = 1 A = 2   print (a + A) would be 3 becuase upercause and lower case =
# something different
# when saying print you can not have a lower cause but if you say print 
# ("") you can use upercause in that part of code and that part only
# if I did 27 % 4 if would say 3  because 27 divided by 4 is 6 with a 
# remainder of 3 wich is why it is 3
# if you did A = 1 something and later in the code A = 3
# would be whatever you said A equaled closest to in the code
# python always uses pemdas so you may need to use perentices to get the 
# correct answer or you may get the wrong answer 
# Eol syntaxerror means end of line
